'''
What is a List?
A list is an ordered, mutable (changeable) collection of items. This means:

Ordered: The items in a list have a defined order, and that order will not change unless you explicitly modify it. You can access items by their index.

Mutable: You can change, add, or remove items from a list after it has been created.

Collection: A list can hold multiple items.

Heterogeneous: List items do not all have to be of the same data type. You can have integers, strings, floats, other lists, and even custom objects all in the same list.
